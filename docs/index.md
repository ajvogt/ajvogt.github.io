# About Me
I am a Data Science Technical Lead at Bayer Crop Science.  As a Physicist turned Data Scientist,
I currently lead a team focused on prescriptive analytics and models that can recommend or automate business decisions. 
I enjoy focusing on results and navigating organization complexity by leveraging my professional network and building alignment across roles.
I'm also an avid learner with interests in statistical physics (stochastic and complex systems), game theory, and optimization.
Finally, I'm big advocate for best practices, MLOps, and insightful data visualization to achieve stakeholder trust and agile model deployment.
